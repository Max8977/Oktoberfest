Oktoberfest
===========

A simple Windows Phone app. Select from a small set of English phrases which you might find useful during a visit at the Oktoberfest, and the English translation will show up.

I published this on the Windows Phone marketplace a while ago: http://www.windowsphoneapplist.com/en/Oktoberfest-a29095.html - mostly out of curiosity if anyone would actually pay $0.99 for the full version. A few people did. :-)
